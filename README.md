## Compilation

- **Compiled Language:** Programs are translated into machine language, executed by hardware (C).
- **Interpreted Language:** Programs are read and executed by a software interpreter (Python).
- **Hybrid:** Java compiles into Java bytecode, then interpreted by JVM.
- **Statically-Typed Language:** Variables are known at compile time (C).
- **Dynamically-Typed Language:** Variables are known only at runtime (Python).

### Compilation Process
1. **Preprocessing:** `#include` directive causes the source code from `.h` file to be inserted.
2. **Parsing:** Compiler reads source code and builts an **abstract syntax tree**. Detects syntax errors.
3. **Static Checking:** Compiler checks whether variables, values have the right type, etc. Detects static semantic errors.
4. **Code Generation:** Compiler reads program and generates machine code.
5. **Linking:** If the program uses libraries, compiler finds the appropriate libraries and includes the required code.
6. **Optimization:** At several points in the process, the compiler generates code that runs faster or uses less space.

### Object Code
- `-c` flag tells `gcc` to compile program and generate machine code.
- Result is `name.o` file, which is not yet executable.
- `nm hello.o` reads object file and generates information about defined functions.

### Assembly Code
- `-S` flag tells `gcc` to compile program and generate assembly code (human-readable).
- Shows low-level code representation.

### Preprocessing
- `-E` flag tells `gcc` to run the preprocessor only.
- Shows included code in `name.h` and all the files included from `name.h`, etc.

### Error Messages
1. **Preprocessor Errors:** Wrong `#include` directive.
2. **Syntax Errors:** Expected `;`.
3. **Linker Errors:** Use a function not defined in any library.
4. **Runtime Errors:** Segmentation faults (read/write to invalid memory), floating point (illegal operation), division by 0.
